-- #Exercise 1: DVD Rental



-- Find out how many films there are for each rating
1. SELECT count(rating) FROM film WHERE rating = 'G'
SELECT count(rating) FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG'
SELECT count(rating) FROM film WHERE rating = 'PG-13'
SELECT count(rating) FROM film WHERE rating = 'R'
SELECT count(rating) FROM film WHERE rating = 'NC-17'



-- Get a list of all the movies that have a rating of G or PG-13
2. SELECT title, rating FROM film WHERE rating IN('G', 'PG-13')

-- Filter this list further: look for only movies that are under 2 hours long, and whose rental price (rental_rate) is under 3.00. Sort the list alphabetically.
SELECT title, rating FROM film WHERE rating IN('G', 'PG-13') AND length = 120 AND rental_rate < 3 ORDER BY title ASC


-- Find a customer in the customer table, and change his/her details to your details, using SQL UPDATE.
3. UPDATE customer SET first_name = 'Nessim', last_name = 'Azoulay', email = 'ness.azoulay.ta@gmail.com' WHERE customer id= 3


-- Now find the customerâ€™s address, and use UPDATE to change it to an address of your own (or make one up).
4. SELECT * FROM customer JOIN address on customer.address_id = address.address_id ORDER BY customer_id
UPDATE address SET address = 'Heart Street' WHERE address_id = 3






-- # Exercise 2

2. INSERT INTO students(math_grade) VALUES (80) WHERE id=1

3. INSERT INTO students(math_grade) VALUES (90) WHERE id=2 and id=4

4. INSERT INTO students(math_grade) VALUES (40) WHERE id=6
